## Description
This pull request completes the implementation of all routes for the Node.js API. It includes the functionality for fetching all products, fetching a single product by ID, updating a product, and deleting a product. Additionally, a form has been set up to facilitate editing of product details in the edit route.

## Changes Made
- Added routes to fetch all products, fetch a single product by ID, update a product, and delete a product
- Implemented the necessary logic to handle each route's functionality
- Created an edit form to allow users to modify product details

## Testing
To test the changes locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`
3. Start the application using `npm start`
4. Use API endpoints such as `/product` to fetch all products, `/product/:id` to fetch a single product, `/product/:id` (with a PUT request) to update a product, and `/product/:id` (with a DELETE request) to delete a product
5. Verify that each route functions as expected and produces the desired results
6. Test the edit form by navigating to the appropriate route and modifying product details through the form
